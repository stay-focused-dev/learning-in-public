## Saturday. Session 1

I am learning Go again. I have some experience with it, but that was a while back. I want to refresh my knowledge of the language and its ecosystem before diving into more mature projects. I asked Claude for resources, and he recommended starting with "A Tour of Go". Since I learn better by writing code than just reading, I'm going to work through all the examples in the book, not just the exercises.

Time spent: 72 minutes
