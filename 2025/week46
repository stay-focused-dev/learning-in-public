## Wednesday. Session 1

I watched Sameer Ajmani's video from Google I/O 2013 "Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns". He built a simple RSS client and showed how to avoid some bugs in a naive implementation. He emphasized:

- possible data races from concurrent mutation of shared state
- unresponsive behaviour when doing I/O or sleeping before the next event
- possible deadlocks when a channel is closed and a goroutine tries to send to it

I was fascinated by these examples especially by "chan chan error" and how we can make our code simpler (without nested cases) using select and message passing. 

It was a 34-minute video, but I had to spend a lot of effort to grasp these ideas. I watched the video for the first time, then implemented the functionality, understood some details, and then watched the video again. Now I feel like I understand it.

Time spent: 215 minutes

## Friday. Session 1


I decided to dive into one of the popular Go projects on GitHub and found Traefik interesting. The project provides a getting-started page where two services run using Docker Compose:

- Traefik
- whoami (a simple HTTP server)

Traefik automatically discovers the whoami service and configures it so I can curl some of the whoami endpoints.

Then I thought: building a webserver is a typical programming task—it would be nice to collect tasks like this in my own library. When I learn a new language, I can use these exercises to learn the basics of the language and its ecosystem. So I created a repo for such exercises and added a whoami-like service exercise to it.

Time spent: 91 minutes
