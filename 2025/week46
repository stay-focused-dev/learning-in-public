## Wednesday. Session 1

I watched Sameer Ajmani's video from Google I/O 2013 "Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns". He built a simple RSS client and showed how to avoid some bugs in a naive implementation. He emphasized:

- possible data races from concurrent mutation of shared state
- unresponsive behaviour when doing I/O or sleeping before the next event
- possible deadlocks when a channel is closed and a goroutine tries to send to it

I was fascinated by these examples especially by "chan chan error" and how we can make our code simpler (without nested cases) using select and message passing. 

It was a 34-minute video, but I had to spend a lot of effort to grasp these ideas. I watched the video for the first time, then implemented the functionality, understood some details, and then watched the video again. Now I feel like I understand it.

Time spent: 215 minutes
